\section{Conclusion}
The study examined the vulnerability of cryptographic systems like AES to cache state analysis attacks, noting that methods using data-dependent memory access or large lookup tables are particularly at risk. System-level concerns were also raised as both multi-user systems and single-user machines could be affected. Some countermeasures were proposed but none were entirely efficient, leaving the mitigation of such attacks an open problem.
