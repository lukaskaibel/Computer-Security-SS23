# Project Report: Techniques and Strategies Used

This project focuses on deciphering a set of encoded texts, which are read from a file and expected to be encoded using a one-time pad (OTP) cipher. The main strategy used is brute-forcing keys generated from a seed until a valid English sentence is found.

## Techniques Used

1. **Brute Force Decryption:** This project uses a brute force method to decode the ciphertexts. The key is generated by incrementing a seed value from zero. For each key, the program attempts to decode a ciphertext. If the decoded text does not contain a valid English phrase, the program increments the seed value and tries again. The process continues until the decoded text is identified as English, indicating a potential valid decryption.

2. **English Detection:** The `contains_english` function is used to verify if the decoded text is in English. This function is instrumental in determining the termination condition for the brute force loop. It checks if a decrypted text contains English words or phrases and returns a boolean value.

3. **One-Time Pad (OTP) Cipher:** OTP is a type of encryption where the plaintext is combined with a random key or "pad" that is as long as the plaintext and used only once. In this project, the `OTP` function is used to decrypt the ciphertexts with the generated keys.

4. **File Operations:** The project reads ciphertexts from files using the `read_from_file` function. It also writes decrypted texts and the keys used for decryption into separate files using the `write_to_file` function.

## Strategies Implemented

1. **Sequential Key Generation:** A key is generated for each iteration using the `gen_key_from_seed` function. The seed is an integer that increments at each loop iteration.

2. **Ciphertext Selection:** The program attempts to decode each ciphertext in the given list one by one. If a ciphertext is successfully decoded, it is written into a file along with the key used for decryption.

3. **Repeated Key Check:** After each successful decryption, the project checks if the same key can be used to decrypt any of the remaining ciphertexts. If so, the corresponding decrypted text is also written into a file.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of brute force decryption with one-time pad ciphers, English detection, and file handling techniques. It underscores the effectiveness of brute force methods in breaking simple ciphers when the number of potential keys is reasonably small.

## How to use

The following explains, how to break the encryption of the 13 ciphertexts provided in the `./ciphertexts` directory.

1. **Install NLTK:** Run `pip install nltk` to install the natural language toolkit, used to detect english words.

2. **Execute Attack:** Run `python main.py` to execute the attack. The attempts will be printed every 100 tries. The average attempts will be 32,000 per ciphertext.

3. **View Decrypted Ciphertexts:** The decrypted results will be in the main directory as `Decrypt-Ciphertext-i`.
